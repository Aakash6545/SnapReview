## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A GitHub account
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for exposing your local server

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aakash6545/SnapReview.git
cd snapreview
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
GITHUB_APP_ID=your_github_app_id
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=your_github_private_key
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
PORT=3000
```

### Step 4: Create your GitHub App

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Navigate to "Developer settings" > "GitHub Apps" > "New GitHub App"
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: SnapReview (or your preferred name)
   - **Homepage URL**: http://localhost:3000 (for development)
   - **Webhook URL**: Your ngrok URL (from step 5) + `/github-webhook`
   - **Webhook Secret**: Create a random string (use this as your `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
   
4. Set the following permissions:
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - **Pull requests**: Read & Write
     - **Contents**: Read-only
   - **Subscribe to events**:
     - Pull request
